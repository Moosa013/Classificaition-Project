    "From the inception of printed newspapers, every article has been assigned to a specific section. While many aspects of the newspaper industry have evolved—ranging from ink and paper types to distribution methods—the practice of categorizing news has persisted across generations, extending into digital formats. Newspaper articles cover a broad spectrum of topics, including politics, sports, and entertainment. Historically, categorization was primarily a manual process, but advancements in technology now allow for automated classification with minimal effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to design and develop an application that predicts the categories of news articles intended for publication. By utilizing classification algorithms, we will analyze the content of articles to determine their respective genres. The proposed algorithm will not only classify existing topics but also adapt to new topics as they emerge in the content. While the algorithm is extendable to multiple languages, this paper will primarily focus on English.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the realm of news article classification, multi-label text classification poses a significant challenge. Our objective is to assign one or more category labels to each article. For each category, classifiers will provide binary responses—either \"yes\" or \"no\"—indicating whether a specific category applies to the given test data. This approach utilizes binary classifiers, and we will implement several standard algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machines, and Logistic Regression, which are commonly used for binary classification. We will evaluate these three approaches and select the best model based on predetermined parameters for predicting news categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "A robust category classification algorithm for news articles must achieve high precision while remaining easily updatable. Given the continuous evolution of news topics and events, the ability to seamlessly add new categories to the classifier is essential."
